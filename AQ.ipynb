The algorithm updates the tentative distances of neighboring nodes, ensuring that the shortest path to each node is determined efficiently.\n",

This required tracking not only the current cost and distance but also the number of stops made along the route.

    "\n",
    "The main computation happens in the while loop that processes nodes from the priority queue. For each node in the graph, we can visit it up to $k+1$ times (representing 0 to $k$ stops). This means a single node might appear in the queue multiple times, each time with a different number of stops taken to reach it. With $N$ nodes that can each be processed up to $k+1$ times, the maximum number of elements that can ever be in the priority queue is $O(N \\cdot k)$ .\n",
    "For each node processing, we perform a heap removal operation that takes $O(\\log(N \\cdot k))$ time. We then examine all outgoing edges from that node, which on average is $O(\\frac{E}{N})$ edges per node in a typical graph. For each edge examined, we might perform a heap insertion operation, also taking $O(\\log(N \\cdot k))$ time.\n",
