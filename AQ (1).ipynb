        "   - In dense graphs ($E \\approx N^2$), the complexity can grow to $O(k \\cdot N^2 \\cdot \\log(N \\cdot k))$, which becomes computationally expensive for large $N$.\n",

However, for very large or dense graphs, and when $k$ is high, its performance may degrade. Practical efficiency depends heavily on graph structure, the number of flights per airport, and the constraints on $k$. Optimizations such as pruning redundant paths or early stopping could mitigate some of these limitations.\n"
